RESEARCH FOCUS COMPARISON:\n\nPaper 1 focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM and SVR, to predict stock price movement using various stock index data. The core research question would be to determine the effectiveness of deep learning methods in predicting stock prices compared to traditional approaches.\n\nPaper 2, on the other hand, presents a deep learning model based on a time series LSTM model to detect anomalous behaviors in the Chinese stock market. The main research focus is to improve anomaly detection in financial markets using a deep learning approach.\n\nBoth papers share a common objective of utilizing deep learning techniques for financial market analysis. However, Paper 1 concentrates on stock price prediction, while Paper 2 is centered around anomaly detection. The domains of these papers include finance, machine learning, and data analysis.\n\n2. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH:\n\nIn terms of methodological approach, both papers use deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM models. However, they differ in their application and configuration.\n\nPaper 1 employs LSTM with 7 hidden layers, an Adam optimizer, sigmoid activation function, and dropout of 0.2 for prediction. The researcher used time-series data of various stock indexes from Jan 2015 to Jan 2020 with a window size of 30 days for training and testing purposes. Additionally, SVR with different kernel functions was used for comparison.\n\nPaper 2 uses a univariate and multivariate time series models approach with a Conv1D-LSTM model to derive features from datasets, especially in time series data. The data is split into training and testing data according to the 'tradeDate', where the first 1000 days are set to training data, and the last 219 days are used for validation.\n\nBoth papers share similarities in their use of LSTM models and time-series data, but Paper 2 incorporates a Conv1D layer for feature extraction and uses a different data splitting approach.\n\n3. FINDINGS AND RESULTS:\n\nPaper 1's key finding is that LSTM outperforms SVR in predicting stock price movement with a lower MAPE value. The researcher observed that LSTM could capture long-term dependencies in stock price data, while SVR struggled to capture the same.\n\nPaper 2 demonstrates that the proposed method improved MSE to 0.0171 on validation datasets and successfully predicts the anomalous price behaviors of '601318' stock in the range of 2019-02-13. The paper also shows that the model analyzed the price of 14 stocks with univariate and multivariate time series models, generating MAE less than 4.0 consistently.\n\nBoth papers provide valuable insights into the application of deep learning techniques in financial market analysis. Paper 1 focuses on stock price prediction accuracy, while Paper 2 highlights the ability to detect anomalous behaviors.\n\n4. SCHOLARLY CONTRIBUTION:\n\nPaper 1 contributes to the field by providing evidence that deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM, can improve stock price prediction accuracy compared to traditional approaches. This finding can help practitioners and researchers make better-informed decisions regarding stock price movement.\n\nPaper 2's contribution lies in presenting a deep learning model for anomaly detection in financial markets, specifically the Chinese stock market. The proposed method can help investors, regulatory authorities, and market participants identify and respond to anomalous behaviors in a timely manner.\n\n5. SYNTHESIS:\n\nIn summary, both papers contribute to the broader research landscape of financial market analysis using deep learning techniques. While Paper 1 focuses on stock price prediction, Paper 2 addresses anomaly detection. Both papers use LSTM models and time-series data but employ different configurations and methodological approaches. The findings of these papers can help improve the accuracy of stock price predictions and enhance anomaly detection capabilities in financial markets. Practitioners and researchers can benefit from the insights provided by these studies in making informed decisions and developing more sophisticated models for financial market analysis."}}
